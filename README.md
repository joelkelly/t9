#T9#

Finally, a technology that you can use when all other means of communication break down.  Feel the wonder of typing out full sentences in as little as 2-10 minutes (depending on your speed).

This is a simple code test base heavily *(read: very little actual code was written)* on Mitch Robb's [article](http://www.mitchrobb.com/t9-in-javascript-with-a-prefix-tree/) and subsequent [code](https://github.com/olslash/t9).  I also looked into [John Resig's](http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-trie-performance-analysis/) info on Trie performance.  Most of the work here is just adjusting the interface a bit so it was cleaner to look at and use.  It has keyboard support and usingyourmouse support (fancy).

Tried to keep it super simple, all vanilla javascript and no preprocessed CSS.  We are partying like it is 1999 on this one.

###How to use###

If you have a preferred server method just fire that up and point it to index.html.  If you would rather just type a few commands not a problem.

*(NOTE: Please feel free to use your keyboard, T9 Entry of setup commands is NOT required)*

1.  Make sure you have node/npm installed
2.  Run NPM install from terminal inside your T9 folder
3.  Run the command: npm start -OR- node serve.js if you love typing the "." character
4.  Bask in the glory of all that is T9! Do not feel limited.  Set your imagination free!
